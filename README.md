# Movies App

This application was developed using React as the front-end framework. The movies are fetched from an external free API that can be found at [this link](https://rapidapi.com/jakash1997/api/advanced-movie-search/).

The application allows the user to search for a specific movie by title or browsing a few categories.

In order to be able to run the application correctly you need a key that can be acquired from [this link]((https://rapidapi.com/jakash1997/api/advanced-movie-search/) by creating a free account and subscribing to the API.

This key must be placed in a .env file as follows: REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_key.

After that you can use `npm install` and `npmn start`.

The application was developed by Roxana Danica.
